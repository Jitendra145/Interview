17. how microservices communicates with each other and what did you use for communication?

Microservices use service discovery which acts as a guide to find the route of communication between each of them. Microservices then communicate with each other via a stateless server i.e. either by HTTP Request/Message Bus. These microservices communicate with each other using an Application Program Interface(API)

18. How will you map same URI with multiple method if Spring controller?

@RequestMapping with Request Parameters
The params element of the @RequestMapping annotation further helps to narrow down request mapping. Using the params element, you can have multiple handler methods handling requests to the same URL, but with different parameters.

19. Have you worked on hibernate?
20. What is Docker and Microservices?
21. What is the difference between an API and a Microservice?

Here are the main differences between APIs and microservices: An API is a contract that provides guidance for a consumer to use the underlying service. A microservice is an architectural design that separates portions of a (usually monolithic) application into small, self-containing services.
Microservices are an increasingly popular architecture for building large-scale applications. Rather than using a single, monolithic codebase, applications are broken down into a collection of smaller components called microservices. ... Docker is an excellent tool for managing and deploying microservices
