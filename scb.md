Microservices use service discovery which acts as a guide to find the route of communication between each of them. Microservices then communicate with each other via a stateless server i.e. either by HTTP Request/Message Bus. These microservices communicate with each other using an Application Program Interface(API)

20. What is Docker and Microservices?
21. What is the difference between an API and a Microservice?

Here are the main differences between APIs and microservices: An API is a contract that provides guidance for a consumer to use the underlying service. A microservice is an architectural design that separates portions of a (usually monolithic) application into small, self-containing services.
Microservices are an increasingly popular architecture for building large-scale applications. Rather than using a single, monolithic codebase, applications are broken down into a collection of smaller components called microservices. ... Docker is an excellent tool for managing and deploying microservices
